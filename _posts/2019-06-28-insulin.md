title: Insulin Prices in America Double
subtitle: Why did the price of a 100-year-old drug suddenly rise?

What could cause suburban moms to make [cross-border drug runs](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/the_americas/as-price-of-insulin-soars-americans-caravan-to-canada-for-lifesaving-medicine/2019/06/14/0a272fb6-8217-11e9-9a67-a687ca99fb3d_story.html?noredirect=on&utm_term=.4ae2ae43c6f3)? Or law-abiding citizens to [share or sell their prescription drugs](https://www.wsj.com/video/series/moving-upstream/high-insulin-prices-drive-diabetics-to-take-extreme-measures/1AB7653D-D0F8-4441-9218-5668D1BC62A7)?

**Insulin prices in the US have doubled since 2012.** Have insulin producers doubled the quality of their insulin? Or perhaps made it twice as effective?

The GIF below shows how the distribution of average insulin price by state changes over time. At the end, it's clear that the price of insulin has changed significantly. **Something has changed.**

It should be noted that insulin use increased only slightly over this period (from 60 units/day to 62), so increased demand doesn't account for the price increase.

This is one of many places in our Health Care market that we see overt market failure. Drastic market failures like this are one of many reasons our Health Care costs are so high, and our satisfaction with Health Care is so low.
