This first example includes articles from **Vox**, **The New York Times**, **The Wall Street Journal** and **The Washington Examiner**. I wrote a web scraper for **The Daily Wire** but they don't publish many articles so it will be ~50 days until I have an adequately-sized population to pull my sample from. The **samples in this example should NOT be used for analysis**. The population sizes of all sources besides WSJ are too small which will cause oversampling of articles published around July 11th.

I rewrote my web scrapers to update on a daily basis, rather than trying to retrieve the entire population of articles in one execution. This will get us a sample that is representative of what sources publish on the front page of each section, and avoid oversampling long stories with many update-articles, that may not have been notable. These updated scrapers will find a sample that reflects what news sources find most important.
